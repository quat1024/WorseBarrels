Worse Barrels
=============

I've found a lot of "barrel" mods aren't really to my satisfaction; mainly because they can hold hundreds, even thousands or ten-thousands *stacks* of items in just one block space. Additional mods provide wireless item transport (JABBA), sorting (Storage Drawers), or even basic autocrafting functionality (also Storage Drawers). While these features - don't get me wrong! - are great, and *amazing* for convenience, I'm just not a player that enjoys things being convenient - give me challenges to store and manipulate that many items, don't let me just throw in upgrades until my problems go away.

And thus, Worse Barrels.

These barrels suck, and it's by design. They hold eight stacks of items, period, full stop, the end. There are no upgrades. The size is not configurable.

The intended use is less "Store all of my cobblestone, ever, in the whole world", and more as a small item buffer, filter, or front-end for a larger storage unit somewhere else, that you can bring the items to for convenient one-click access.

Completed features:
* Barrels placeable in 12 directions (NESW, ceiling NESW, floor NESW).
* Interact with the barrels with devices such as hoppers.
* Read the contents of the barrel with a comparator.
* Break or crush the barrel to keep its contents, like a shulker box.
* Dispense the barrel to place it, also like a shulker box.

Planned features:
* Render the item on the front of the barrel. Yknow, so you can actually see what's inside...
* Interact with the barrels to insert and remove items. *Kind of* important.
* More types of barrels!
