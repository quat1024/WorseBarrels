Worse Barrels
=============

I've found a lot of "barrel" mods aren't really to my satisfaction; mainly because they can hold hundreds, even thousands or tens-of-thousands of *stacks* of items in just one block space. Some even provide wireless item transport, sorting, or even basic autocrafting functionality. While these features - don't get me wrong! - are great, and extremely convenient, I'm just not a player that enjoys things being convenient - give me challenges to store and manipulate that many items, don't let me just throw upgrades at the wall until all my problems go away.

And thus, Worse Barrels.

These barrels suck, and it's by design. They hold eight stacks of items, period, full stop, the end. There are no upgrades. The size is not configurable.

The intended use is less "Store all of my cobblestone, ever, in the whole world", and more as a small item buffer, filter, or front-end for a larger storage unit somewhere else, that you can bring the items to for convenient one-click access.

Although, hey, you can nest them - so it's not impossible to store crazy numbers of items in a small space. It'll just be a space much, much larger than one block, and it won't be easy.

Completed features:
* Barrels placeable in 12 directions (NESW, ceiling NESW, floor NESW).
* Interact with the barrels with devices such as hoppers.
* Read the contents of the barrel with a comparator.
* Break or crush the barrel to keep its contents, like a shulker box.
* Dispense the barrel to place it, also like a shulker box.

Planned features:
* Render the item on the front of the barrel. Yknow, so you can actually see what's inside...
* Interact with the barrels to insert and remove items. *Kind of* important.
* More types of barrels!
